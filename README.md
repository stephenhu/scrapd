# scrapd
Crawler gets photos from sites and allows publishing workflows

## requirements

* given a root site, crawl for particular photos and sets of photos
* photos are not to be stored in the scrapd system, links should be established for full photos and thumbnails
* photos should be rated by users, which should be tallied for total score
* tinder like mechanism, swipe left for like, right for dislike
* existing links should not be crawled (perhaps check for updates?)
* also do not allow duplicate photos to be stored
* develop query type semantics
